# Fake-News-Detection
***by Julia Ku≈Çacz***
<br /><br /> This repository contains an application to detect fake news using three different approaches:
1. Naive Bayes model
2. LSTM recurrent neural network
3. Transfer learning approach - BERT
<br />
Each of the above has a separate folder that contains python code to detect fake news and the performance of each approach.
All data were collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/samrat96/fake-news-detection) and divided into fake and real datasets.

This project has been carried out as a part of an engineering thesis at AGH University of Science and Technology.
